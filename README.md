# Automated CI/CD Pipeline with AWS for Java Web Application
This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using AWS services to support a Java-based web application. The primary goal was to create a scalable, secure and efficient DevOps workflow, from source control to deployment, leveraging modern cloud-native tools.

## Project Overview
The CI/CD pipeline was built around key AWS services:
- AWS CodePipeline for orchestration
- AWS CodeBuild for automated builds
- AWS CodeDeploy for seamless deployments
- AWS CodeArtifact for secure dependency management

The application was version-controlled using GitHub, with changes automatically triggering pipeline executions and deployments to an EC2 instance provisioned via CloudFormation.

### Environment Setup
Development began by provisioning a remote EC2 instance with secure SSH access, including the generation of key pairs for authentication. Visual Studio Code with the Remote – SSH extension enabled remote development as if local.

Java and Maven were installed on the EC2 instance to set up the foundational environment. The application was scaffolded using Maven’s archetype feature, providing a standard directory structure for code and web assets.
